Gaussian_Pyramid.py is a python script to realize DoG(Differential of Gaussian).
A Gaussian pyramid of the given image is finally obtained(by default: 4 octaves, with 4 pics in each octave)

The script includes codes that attempt to do fast Gaussian filtering(function: fast_Gaussian_filter), by splitting the convolution process between
the Gaussian kernel with the image into two steps--a normalized Gaussian row vector convoluting with the image first, 
and then a normalized Gaussian column vector, but not successful. The difference can be found by commenting line 104 and 
removing '#' of line 103.
